## Abstract
This thesis aims to implement a service system for nutritionists that facilitates communication with their clients. The system supports the use of a **web platform** for the nutritionist and a **mobile application** for clients. The architecture includes a **backend server using Spring Boot Framework**, which serves both the web platform, and the **mobile application developed with the Jetpack Compose toolkit**.

## Backend Server
The backend server is implemented using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** software architecture pattern. In this project, the Model layer is further divided into sub-layers, such as [repositories](./DietitianHub-Backend/src/main/java/gr/unipi/thesis/dimstyl/repositories/) and [services](./DietitianHub-Backend/src/main/java/gr/unipi/thesis/dimstyl/services/), to better organize different functionalities and database interactions. Additionally, the Controller layer is also further divided into [web](./DietitianHub-Backend/src/main/java/gr/unipi/thesis/dimstyl/controllers/web/) and [api](./DietitianHub-Backend/src/main/java/gr/unipi/thesis/dimstyl/controllers/api/) controllers, as the same server also handles RESTful API calls from the Android application.

The relational database management system used is **PostgreSQL**, which runs in a **Docker container**. For container creation, the [docker-compose.yaml](./DietitianHub-Backend/docker/docker-compose.yml) file is used, while the [init.sql](./DietitianHub-Backend/docker/sql-scripts/init.sql) and [seed-data.sql](./DietitianHub-Backend/docker/sql-scripts/seed-data.sql) files are used to create the database and populate it with mock data.

## Android Application
The Android application is implemented using the **Clean Architecture** software architecture pattern, which is an improved implementation of **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture design pattern.
