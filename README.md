# Integrated Service System for a Nutritionist and Clients â€“ Web Platform and Mobile Application

## [University of Piraeus](https://www.unipi.gr/en/) | [Department of Informatics](https://cs.unipi.gr/en/)

## Abstract
This thesis aims to implement a service system for nutritionists that facilitates communication with their clients. The system supports the use of a **web platform** for the nutritionist and a **mobile application** for clients. The architecture includes a **backend server using Spring Boot Framework**, which serves both the web platform, and the **mobile application developed with the Jetpack Compose toolkit**.

## Backend Server
The backend server is implemented using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** software architecture pattern. In this project, the Model layer is further divided into sub-layers, such as [repositories](./DietitianHub-Backend/src/main/java/gr/unipi/thesis/dimstyl/repositories/) and [services](./DietitianHub-Backend/src/main/java/gr/unipi/thesis/dimstyl/services/), to better organize different functionalities and database interactions. Additionally, the Controller layer is also further divided into [web](./DietitianHub-Backend/src/main/java/gr/unipi/thesis/dimstyl/controllers/web/) and [api](./DietitianHub-Backend/src/main/java/gr/unipi/thesis/dimstyl/controllers/api/) controllers, as the same server also handles RESTful API calls from the Android application.

The relational database management system used is **PostgreSQL**, which runs in a **Docker container**. For container creation, the [docker-compose.yaml](./DietitianHub-Backend/docker/docker-compose.yml) file is used, while the [init.sql](./DietitianHub-Backend/docker/sql-scripts/init.sql) and [seed-data.sql](./DietitianHub-Backend/docker/sql-scripts/seed-data.sql) files are used to create the database and populate it with mock data.

### Frameworks, tools and libraries:
The following are the core frameworks, tools, and libraries used in the backend server. These represent the essential components, and additional tools may also be utilized.
- [Spring Boot Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)
- [Spring Security](https://spring.io/projects/spring-security)
- [Spring AOP](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/core/aop.html)
- [Spring Email](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/io/email.html)

### Implemented Features:
1. View clients
2. Add a new client
3. Delete a client
4. Edit client details
5. Add client tags
6. Upload, view, and delete diet plans for a client
7. Publish, edit, view, and delete announcements
8. Publish, edit, view, and delete personalized articles
9. View appointments
10. Create a new appointment
11. Edit appointment details
12. Cancel, decline, approve, or complete an appointment

## Android Application
The Android application is implemented using the **Clean Architecture** software architecture pattern, which is an improved implementation of **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture design pattern.

### Tools and libraries:
The following tools and libraries are central to the Android application's development. However, there may be additional libraries and tools used in the project that are not explicitly mentioned here.
- [Jetpack Compose toolkit](https://developer.android.com/compose)
- [Navigation component](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose/navigation)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)
- [Gson Converter](https://github.com/square/retrofit/blob/trunk/retrofit-converters/gson/README.md)
- [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/datastore)

### Implemented Features:
1. Edit personal details
2. Download diet plans
3. View appointments
4. Request a new appointment
5. Cancel an appointment
6. View announcements
7. View articles
